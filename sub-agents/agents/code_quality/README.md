# Code Quality Metrics Agent (Scaffold)

This folder contains the scaffolding for EPIC-001. No implementation is provided here yet — only file structure and placeholders that align with the backlog stories.

## Modules (placeholders)
- `main.py` — future entry point exposing `run(args)`
- `scanner.py` — basic file scanning and metrics
- `complexity.py` — cyclomatic complexity calculation
- `duplication.py` — duplicate code detection
- `backlog_writer.py` — generate backlog items from findings
- `smells.py` — code smell detection
- `metrics_store.py` — persist and trend metrics
- `ai_context.py` — AI-friendly context generation
- `learning.py` — learn from fixed issues / prevention rules
- `tests/` — unit tests to be added per story

## Status
- Foundation-only scaffold created per EPIC-000 and EPIC-001. No execution logic yet.
