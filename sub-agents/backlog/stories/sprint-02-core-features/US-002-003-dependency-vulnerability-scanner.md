# US-002-003: Dependency Vulnerability Scanner

**Epic**: EPIC-002
**Sprint**: 2 (Core)
**Points**: 5
**Priority**: High

## Description
As a security engineer, I want to check dependency manifests for known CVEs so that we can remediate vulnerable versions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Scans `package.json`/`package-lock.json` and `requirements.txt` if present
- [ ] Queries a public vulnerability database (e.g., OSV) for advisories
- [ ] Produces JSON report listing package, version, CVE/ID, severity, and fixed versions

## Technical Details
- `/agents/security/deps_vuln_scanner.py`
- Use OSV API for MVP; allow offline mode with cached JSON
- Respect rate limits and implement retry/backoff

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Unit tests >80%
- [ ] Docs for configuration and API key needs (if any)
- [ ] Output schema documented
