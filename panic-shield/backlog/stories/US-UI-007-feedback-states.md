# User Story: Interactive Feedback States

## Story
As a user, I want clear visual feedback when interacting with elements so that I know my actions are being recognized and processed.

## Current State
- Missing hover states on desktop
- No pressed/active states on mobile
- Insufficient focus indicators
- No visual feedback for successful actions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All interactive elements have hover states (desktop)
- [ ] Touch elements show pressed states (mobile)
- [ ] Clear focus indicators for keyboard navigation
- [ ] Success/error feedback for form submissions
- [ ] Disabled states are visually distinct
- [ ] Active/selected states are clear

## Technical Requirements
```css
/* Hover States */
.interactive:hover {
  transform: scale(1.02);
  transition: transform var(--transition-fast);
}

/* Pressed States */
.interactive:active {
  opacity: 0.9;
  transform: scale(0.98);
}

/* Focus States */
.interactive:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid var(--primary);
  outline-offset: 2px;
}

/* Disabled States */
.interactive:disabled {
  opacity: 0.5;
  cursor: not-allowed;
  pointer-events: none;
}

/* Success/Error Feedback */
.success-feedback {
  animation: success-pulse 0.3s ease;
  background-color: var(--success-light);
}

@keyframes success-pulse {
  0%, 100% { transform: scale(1); }
  50% { transform: scale(1.05); }
}
```
