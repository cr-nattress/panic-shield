# User Story: Loading and Transition Animations

## Story
As a user, I want smooth transitions and loading states throughout the app so that the interface feels responsive and I understand when content is being loaded.

## Current State
- No loading states for async operations
- Instant page transitions feel jarring
- No skeleton screens while data loads
- Missing feedback for user actions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Skeleton screens for loading content
- [ ] Smooth page transitions (0.2s ease)
- [ ] Loading spinners for buttons during async operations
- [ ] Fade-in animations for new content
- [ ] Progress indicators for long operations
- [ ] Smooth state changes in components

## Technical Requirements
```css
/* Transition Standards */
--transition-fast: 150ms ease;
--transition-base: 200ms ease;
--transition-slow: 300ms ease;

/* Loading Animations */
@keyframes skeleton-pulse {
  0% { background-color: #f0f0f0; }
  50% { background-color: #e0e0e0; }
  100% { background-color: #f0f0f0; }
}

.skeleton {
  animation: skeleton-pulse 1.5s ease-in-out infinite;
  border-radius: var(--radius-sm);
}

/* Page Transitions */
.page-enter {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(20px);
}

.page-enter-active {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateY(0);
  transition: all var(--transition-base);
}
```

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Create skeleton screen components
- [ ] Add page transition wrapper
- [ ] Implement button loading states
- [ ] Add content fade-in animations
- [ ] Create progress indicators
- [ ] Add micro-interactions
- [ ] Test animation performance

## Testing
- Animation performance testing
- Loading state coverage
- Reduced motion preference support
- Cross-browser animation compatibility
- User perception testing

## Effort Estimate
**Size**: Medium (3-4 days)
