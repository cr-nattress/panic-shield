# US-009: Guided Breathing Exercises

## Story
As a user, I want guided breathing exercises

## Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN I'm in Panic Mode
- WHEN breathing guide starts
- THEN I see/feel: visual bubble, haptic pulse, count
- AND can tap "Too fast" to slow it down
- **Target**: 6 breaths/min target, adaptive pacing

## Priority: P0 (MVP - Phase 1)

## Tasks

### 1. Breathing Visualization
- [ ] Design expanding/contracting circle animation
- [ ] Create breath counter display
- [ ] Add phase indicators (inhale/hold/exhale)
- [ ] Design calming background gradients
- [ ] Create progress indicator

### 2. Multi-Sensory Feedback
- [ ] Implement haptic feedback patterns
- [ ] Add optional audio guidance
- [ ] Create ambient sound options
- [ ] Implement visual pacing cues
- [ ] Add optional voice coaching

### 3. Adaptive Pacing
- [ ] Create "too fast/slow" adjustment buttons
- [ ] Implement automatic pace detection
- [ ] Add heart rate integration (if available)
- [ ] Create personalized pace learning

### 4. Exercise Variations
- [ ] Implement 4-7-8 breathing
- [ ] Add box breathing (4-4-4-4)
- [ ] Create belly breathing guide
- [ ] Add coherent breathing (5-5)
- [ ] Implement emergency rapid calm

### 5. Progress Tracking
- [ ] Track breathing session duration
- [ ] Monitor pace achievement
- [ ] Log calmness ratings
- [ ] Create session history
- [ ] Generate improvement metrics

### 6. Testing
- [ ] Validate breath rates accuracy
- [ ] Test haptic patterns effectiveness
- [ ] Verify adaptive pacing logic
- [ ] Test with various anxiety levels
- [ ] Clinical validation of techniques
- [ ] Battery impact assessment

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All breathing techniques accurate
- [ ] Adaptive pacing responsive
- [ ] Multi-sensory feedback working
- [ ] Achieves 6 breaths/min target
- [ ] User calmness improved
- [ ] Medical review completed
